      <![CDATA[<p><strong>Support a local business &amp; global fair trade artisans!</strong></p>
<p>What a year 2020 has been. While we hope you all stay safe, we know how lucky we are to live in a country like Canada with its social safety net. That's why we feel so strongly about fair trade - trading with these producer partners is all they have for outside income as their governments don't have the means or the will to provide them with that safety net.</p>
<p>So while we are a proud BC and Canadian business, we are also proud to support global artisans around the world. Thank you again for your support.</p>]]>
